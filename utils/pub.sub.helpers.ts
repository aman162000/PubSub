         * It is really unfortunate that we only recieve the msg.id and not the content with the item although publisher recieves the content payload.
         * Attempts were made to get the content payload but in vain
         * In case you were succesfull with getting the content.
         * Please make a pull request with the code.
         * Due credit will be given to you 
         * BUT more than that you will help number of developers. :)
         *  
         * Helpful Notes:
         * For sure we are recieving the item in <stuff></stuff> (You could enable logging to see it (xmmp.helper.createClient)) 
         * Not sure but might be the problem is in pub.sub.plugin
