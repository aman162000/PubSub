# TypeScript Pub Server Node with XMPP Pub-Sub

## Overview

This TypeScript project provides a Pub-Sub server node built on top of XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). The server facilitates the creation of pub-sub nodes, allowing clients to subscribe to these nodes and receive updates when new information is published.

## Features

- **XMPP Integration:** Utilizes the XMPP protocol for efficient and extensible communication.

- **Pub-Sub Nodes:** Enables the creation of pub-sub nodes, acting as channels for publishing and subscribing to specific topics.

- **Subscription Management:** Handles the subscription and unsubscription process for clients interested in a particular pub-sub node.

- **Real-time Updates:** Clients receive real-time updates when new information is published to the subscribed nodes.
